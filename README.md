# react-debounce-search ‚åõüîé
react-debounce-search is a simple and lightweight React app that demonstrates the use of debouncing in a search field. The app features a search input with a debounce function, allowing users to search for a term without triggering an API call on every keystroke. This can help improve the performance of your search functionality by reducing the number of unnecessary requests made to the server.

To use the app, simply enter a search term in the input field and wait for the debounce time to elapse. The app will call API from *[dummyjson](http://dummyjson.com/)* based on search term, allowing you to see how the debounce function is working.
